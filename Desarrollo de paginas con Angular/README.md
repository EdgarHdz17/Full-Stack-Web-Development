Desarrollo de paginas con Angular

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Currently, web pages have become applications in themselves, with more components than ever before, and with more demands from their consumers and customers.
In this course you will learn to use Angular, one of the leading frameworks on the market for the development of single page applications, or known as SPA by the acronym in English for 'Single Page Application'.
In addition, there will be a gradual introduction to the NodeJS language and the development of application interfaces (API for its acronym in English for Application Program Interface), with the aim of developing basic web services to give behavior to the Angular application.
