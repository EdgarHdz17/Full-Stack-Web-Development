Full Stack Web Development in Coursera

Currently, web pages have become applications in themselves, with more components than ever before, and with more demands from their consumers and customers.

This program will allow you to create professional-grade responsive web pages and native mobile apps. Likewise, it will provide you with tools, both to create web pages, applying designs made by professional designers, and to program the backend that supports a mobile or web application.

The program is intended for anyone interested in learning, in a practical way, to program reactive pages and mobile apps.

It is developed in 4 MOOCs of 4 weeks each.
